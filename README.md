## Overview

**mpv Configurator** is a simple GUI that creates mpv.conf files that the media player mpv can use. 

Currently, mpv Configurator is in beta. This means it's not very optimized and might screw up on different operating systems. 

## Downloads

Pre-compiled zips are coming soonâ„¢.

## FAQ:

**Are you affiliated with the mpv guys?**

No.

**Your GUI looks like shit in [platform], it doesn't even scale and is hard to use on my 1024x600 screen.**

This is a very well known problem. Might be fixed later on.

**Your shit has memory leaks, get real!**

B-But it's just a beta. Yes, this is a known issue.

This is my second "major" C++ project, please bear with me.
